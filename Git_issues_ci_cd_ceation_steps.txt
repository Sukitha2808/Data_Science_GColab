Absolutely! Let’s cover two key topics: Git features and CI/CD on GitHub, both essential for modern software development and collaboration.

1. Git Features
Git is the version control system that powers GitHub. Here are its most important features:

a. Branching
Branch: A copy of your codebase where you can work on new features or experiments without affecting the main code.
Purpose: Develop features, fix bugs, or experiment safely.
Example: The default branch is usually called main or master.
b. Merging
Merge: Combining changes from one branch into another, usually after code review.
Use case: You finish a feature in a branch and merge it back into main.
c. Commit History
Commits: Snapshots of your code with messages describing changes.
History: Lets you track who made what change and when.
d. Collaboration
Pull Requests (PRs): Propose changes from a branch, discuss with teammates, and review before merging.
Issues: Track bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
e. Staging
Staging Area: You select ("stage") which changes you want to include in your next commit.
Commands:
git add <file> stages a file.
git commit -m "message" saves staged changes.
f. Reverting & Undoing Changes
You can undo mistakes, revert to previous states, and resolve conflicts.
2. CI/CD on GitHub
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery.

a. Continuous Integration (CI)
Definition: Automatically test and build your code whenever you push changes.
Benefits: Catch errors early, ensure code quality, automate tests.
GitHub Actions: GitHub’s built-in tool for automating CI workflows.
b. Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)
Definition: Automatically deploy your code to production or staging after passing tests.
Benefits: Faster releases, less manual work, safer deployments.
c. How CI/CD Works on GitHub
You create a workflow file (usually .github/workflows/main.yml) describing automated steps.
Every push or pull request can trigger these workflows (e.g., running tests, building code, deploying).
d. Example Workflow

.github/workflows/ci.yml
v1
name: CI Example
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
This file will:

Run every time you push or open a pull request.
Check out your code, set up Python, install dependencies, and run your tests.
Task 7: Explore GitHub Actions
Instructions:

Go to your repository on GitHub.
Click on the “Actions” tab.
Browse the available workflow templates or try creating a simple workflow (like the one above).
See how workflows are triggered by pushes or pull requests.
Let me know once you’ve explored GitHub Actions, or if you want step-by-step guidance to set up your first workflow!

How to collaborate using Issues and Pull Requests (PRs)—with commands and workflow
How to automate collaboration using CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
1. Collaboration: Issues & Pull Requests
a. Issues: Tracking Bugs and Tasks
What is an Issue?
An Issue is a GitHub feature to track bugs, feature requests, tasks, or questions related to your project.

How to Create an Issue (GitHub Web):

Go to your repository.
Click on the “Issues” tab.
Click “New issue.”
Fill out the title and description.
Click “Submit new issue.”
Command Line (with GitHub CLI):

bash
gh issue create --title "Bug: Login fails" --body "Steps to reproduce: ..."
b. Pull Requests (PRs): Proposing and Reviewing Changes
What is a Pull Request?
A PR lets you propose changes from a branch, discuss and review with teammates, then merge into the main codebase.

Typical Workflow:
Create a Branch

bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
Make Changes & Commit

bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my new feature"
Push Branch to GitHub

bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
Open a Pull Request (GitHub Web):

Go to your repository.
Click “Pull requests” > “New pull request.”
Select your branch and describe your changes.
Command Line (with GitHub CLI):

bash
gh pr create --base main --head feature/my-new-feature --title "Add my new feature" --body "Description of the feature"
Review and Discuss:

Teammates can comment, suggest changes, and approve.
Make changes as needed and push more commits.
Merge the PR:

Click “Merge pull request” in GitHub Web, or use:
bash
gh pr merge <PR-number>
2. CI/CD Implementation with GitHub Actions
This automates testing and validation of PRs before merging.

Sample CI Workflow for PRs
Add this file to your repository:


.github/workflows/ci.yml
v2
name: Pull Request CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
How it works:

Every time a PR is opened or updated targeting main, this workflow runs.
It checks out your code, sets up Python, installs dependencies, and runs tests.
If tests fail, you see feedback on the PR page, and merging is blocked until issues are resolved.

You said: n o i didn't understand
n o i didn't understand
Copilot said: No problem! Let’s break it down in
No problem! Let’s break it down in a simpler way, step by step.

1. Issues: How to Track Bugs or Tasks
What is an Issue?
An Issue is like a note or ticket where you write down a problem, a new idea, or something to do.

How do you create one?

On GitHub, go to your repository (for example, Bosch).
Click on the “Issues” tab at the top.
Click “New issue”.
Fill in the title (like “Fix login bug”) and description (explain the problem).
Click “Submit new issue”.
Why use Issues?

You can keep track of things to fix or add.
Other people can see and help with your ideas or problems.
2. Pull Requests (PRs): Suggest Changes to Code
What is a Pull Request?
A Pull Request is a way to suggest changes to the code. You make changes on a separate copy (branch), then ask to add those changes to the main code.

Step-by-step Example:
a. Create a Branch (a separate copy for your changes)
Open your terminal or VS Code and type:

bash
git checkout -b my-feature
This makes a new branch called my-feature.

b. Make Changes
Edit your code or add files.

c. Save Your Changes
bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added my new feature"
d. Send Your Changes to GitHub
bash
git push origin my-feature
e. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
Go to your repository.
Click the “Pull Requests” tab.
Click “New pull request”.
Choose your branch (my-feature).
Write a title and description for your changes.
Click “Create pull request”.
Why use PRs?

Other people can see your changes, give feedback, and approve them before they go into the main code.
3. CI/CD: Automatic Checking of Your Code
What is CI/CD?

CI (Continuous Integration): Every time someone suggests changes (makes a PR), GitHub can automatically check if the code works (like running tests).
CD (Continuous Deployment): After tests pass, the code can automatically be put into use (deployed).
How does it work?

You add a special file to your repository called a workflow.
When a PR is made or code is pushed, GitHub runs the workflow and shows if the tests pass.
Example workflow file:

.github/workflows/ci.yml
v3
name: Simple CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
This file tells GitHub to run a script every time a pull request is made.

Would you like to try creating an Issue, making a Pull Request, or setting up a workflow?
Tell me which one you want to practice next, and I’ll guide you with very simple steps!

You said: yes
yes
Copilot said: Great! Let’s do a hands-on practice for
Great! Let’s do a hands-on practice for collaboration using Issues, Pull Requests (PRs), and a basic CI/CD workflow in your repository. We'll use your repository Sukitha2808/Bosch as a real example.

Step 1: Create an Issue
Go to https://github.com/Sukitha2808/Bosch/issues.
Click "New issue".
Fill in:
Title: e.g., "Test Issue: Add greeting message file"
Description: e.g., "Practice issue creation for GitHub learning."
Click "Submit new issue".
Let me know once you’ve created the issue!

Step 2: Create a Branch and Push a Change (Using Terminal or VS Code)
Open your terminal or VS Code and run the following commands:
Clone your repo to your computer (if not already done):

bash
git clone https://github.com/Sukitha2808/Bosch.git
cd Bosch
Create a new branch for your change:

bash
git checkout -b add-greeting
Add a new file:

bash
echo "Hello from GitHub collaboration practice!" > greeting.txt
git add greeting.txt
git commit -m "Add greeting.txt file"
Push your branch to GitHub:

bash
git push origin add-greeting
Step 3: Make a Pull Request (PR)
Go to https://github.com/Sukitha2808/Bosch/pulls.
You should see your branch (add-greeting) with an option to create a pull request.
Click "New pull request".
Fill in:
Title: e.g., "Add greeting.txt file"
Description: e.g., "This PR adds a greeting message file as practice for collaboration."
Click "Create pull request".
Step 4: Set Up CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
Let’s add a simple workflow that runs when you make a pull request.

Add this file to your repository:

.github/workflows/pr-check.yml
name: PR Check

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
How to add:

Create the folder .github/workflows/ in your repo (if it doesn't exist).
Create the file named pr-check.yml and paste the content above.
Commit and push the file to your main branch.
bash
git checkout main
# (Create the file as above)
git add .github/workflows/pr-check.yml
git commit -m "Add PR check workflow"
git push origin main
Summary of Steps
Create an issue.
Make a new branch and add a file.
Push your branch and create a Pull Request.
Add a workflow file for CI/CD.
Let me know which step you’re at, or if you need help with any command or action! I’ll guide you through each part.

Copilot said: Absolutely! Let’s walk through a hands-on collaboration
Absolutely! Let’s walk through a hands-on collaboration workflow for a simple Python code project in your repository (Sukitha2808/Bosch).
We’ll cover:

Creating an Issue
Making a change in a branch
Opening a Pull Request (PR)
Setting up a CI/CD workflow to automatically test your Python code
I’ll keep each step simple and actionable. Let’s get started!

Step 1: Create an Issue
Go to your repo’s Issues tab: Bosch Issues
Click New issue
Example:
Title: Add a Python script to print "Hello, Bosch!"
Description: Create a Python file that prints a greeting message for practice.
Submit the issue. Let me know once done!

Step 2: Create a Branch and Add Python Code
Using Terminal or VS Code:
Clone the repo (if you haven’t):

bash
git clone https://github.com/Sukitha2808/Bosch.git
cd Bosch
Create a new branch:

bash
git checkout -b add-hello-python
Create a Python file: Save the following content as hello_bosch.py:


hello_bosch.py


print("Hello, Bosch!")

Code

4. **Add and commit the file:**
   ```bash
   git add hello_bosch.py
   git commit -m "Add hello_bosch.py to print greeting"
Push the branch:
bash
git push origin add-hello-python
Step 3: Open a Pull Request (PR)
Go to the Pull Requests tab in your repo.
GitHub will suggest your new branch (add-hello-python) for a PR.
Click New pull request.
Fill in the title and description (e.g., "Add hello_bosch.py with greeting").
Click Create pull request.
Step 4: Set Up CI/CD Workflow to Test Python Code
Let’s add a workflow so every PR runs a check to see if your Python code works.

Add this file to your repo:

.github/workflows/python-ci.yml
v1
name: Python CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
How to add:

In your repo, create a folder .github/workflows/ if it doesn’t exist.
Create a file named python-ci.yml in that folder.
Paste the above YAML content.
Commit and push to your branch, or (recommended) to main:
bash
git checkout main
# Add the file
git add .github/workflows/python-ci.yml
git commit -m "Add Python CI workflow"
git push origin main
Recap
Issue: You created a task for your project.
Branch/Code: You made a new branch and added a Python file.
PR: You proposed your change for review.
CI/CD: You set up a workflow to automatically test your Python code on every PR.
Let me know which step you are at, or if you want me to help with the file creation or pushing directly to your repo!

Copilot said: Great questions! Let’s clarify both points: --- ## 1.
Great questions! Let’s clarify both points:

1. Issues: Repository-wide vs File-specific
Issues are for the entire repository.
When you create an issue in a repository, it’s not tied to a specific file by default.
You can use an issue to talk about any aspect of the repository: bugs, new features, code improvements, documentation, etc.
If your issue is about a particular file, mention the file name or path in the issue description, but the issue itself is still visible and relevant to the whole project.
Example:

Issue title: “Fix typo in README.md”
Issue body: “There’s a spelling mistake in line 10 of README.md.”
2. Workflows: Repository-wide vs File-specific
GitHub Actions workflows are for the repository.
When you create a workflow (like in .github/workflows/python-ci.yml), it’s set up for the entire repository.
The workflow will run based on the triggers you set (e.g., when code is pushed, when a pull request is opened).
The workflow can be configured to run checks on the whole repository, specific files, or certain folders.
But:

You can write workflow steps that only run on certain files or folders by adding conditions.
For example, you can make a workflow only run if a .py file was changed.
Example workflow that runs only if Python files are changed:


.github/workflows/python-ci.yml
v2
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '**.py'
Summary Table
Feature	Scope	Details
Issues	Repository	You can mention files, but issues are for the whole project
Workflows	Repository	Can be triggered for whole repo, or limited to certain files
Do you want an example of how to link an issue to a file, or see how to set up a file-specific workflow?
Let me know, and I’ll guide you step by step!

You said: yes
yes
Copilot said: Perfect! Here’s a **practical guide** for you
Perfect! Here’s a practical guide for you on how issues and workflows work in your repository, using a Python file as an example.

1. Issues: Scope and Best Practice
Scope: Issues belong to the whole repository, not just one file.
Best Practice: If your issue is about a specific file, mention that file in your issue’s description or title.
Example: Creating an Issue for a Python File
Suppose you want someone to add a test for hello_bosch.py.

Issue Title:

Add a test for hello_bosch.py

Issue Description:

Please create a test file that checks the output of hello_bosch.py.

2. Workflows: Scope and Targeting Files
Scope: Workflows are set up for the whole repository.
Targeting Specific Files:
You can configure workflows to run only when certain files (like .py files) change.
Example: Python Workflow for Specific Files
This workflow runs only when any Python file (*.py) is changed or a pull request is made that touches a Python file:


.github/workflows/python-ci.yml
v3
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '**.py'
How it works:

If you push or create a PR that changes any .py file, this workflow runs automatically.
It lists all Python files and runs each one.
Summary
Issues: For the whole repo, but can mention files.
Workflows: For the whole repo, but can be triggered by specific files or folders.
Want to try?
Create an issue in your repo and mention a Python file (e.g., ask for a test for hello_bosch.py).
Add the workflow above to .github/workflows/python-ci.yml in your repo to automate Python checks.
Let me know if you want step-by-step help for either part!

Copilot said: Great question! Here’s a clear explanation of
Great question! Here’s a clear explanation of what a workflow automates in GitHub Actions and some practical examples for Python projects.

What Does a Workflow Automate?
A workflow in .github/workflows/ is a set of instructions that GitHub automatically runs for you.
It can automate things like:

Running tests: Check your code for errors each time you push changes or open a pull request.
Linting (code style checks): Make sure your code follows style guidelines.
Building your project: Compile code or package files.
Deployment: Automatically publish your app or website to a server or cloud.
Sending notifications: Inform you or your team when something happens (like a failed test).
Any custom script or command: Anything you can do from the terminal, you can automate in a workflow!
Example: Python Workflow
Suppose you have a Python project with some tests in test_hello.py.

This workflow will:
Run every time you push code or open a pull request.
Set up Python.
Install your dependencies.
Run your tests.
Report back in GitHub (success or failure).

.github/workflows/python-ci.yml
v4
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
What’s automated here?

Every code change is tested automatically.
You don’t have to run tests manually—GitHub does it for you and shows the result on your PR or commit.
Workflow Triggers
You decide when your workflow runs. Common triggers:

push: when you push code.
pull_request: when you open/update a pull request.
schedule: on a set timetable.
workflow_dispatch: you run it manually.
Summary
Workflows automate repetitive tasks (testing, building, deploying, etc.).
They run automatically based on triggers you define.
They help you catch mistakes early and save time.
Would you like to see a workflow that does something else (like deployment) or need help adding this to your repo? Let me know!

You said: how it will identify where it is
how it will identify where it is c orpython file?
Copilot said: Great question! GitHub Actions workflows identify file
Great question! GitHub Actions workflows identify file types (such as Python or C files) by their file extension—for example, .py for Python and .c for C. This is set in the workflow’s trigger conditions, called paths:.

Here’s how it works:

How Workflows Identify File Types
1. By File Extension
Python files: End with .py (like hello.py)
C files: End with .c (like main.c)
Other types: Use their extensions (.js for JavaScript, .java for Java, etc.)
2. Using the paths: Filter in Workflow YAML
When you define a workflow in .github/workflows/, you can tell GitHub Actions to only run when certain file types change.

Example: Run only for Python files

YAML
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '**.py'
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.py'
Example: Run only for C files

YAML
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '**.c'
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.c'
3. What Happens in the Workflow
If you push or update a pull request that changes a .py file, the workflow for Python will run.
If you push or update a pull request that changes a .c file, the workflow for C will run.
You can even combine them!

Example: Run for Python and C files

YAML
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '**.py'
      - '**.c'
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.py'
      - '**.c'
Summary Table
File Type	Extension	Workflow Trigger Example
Python	.py	paths: - '**.py'
C	.c	paths: - '**.c'
Both	.py, .c	paths: - '**.py' - '**.c'
Would you like a ready-to-use workflow file for Python, C, or both?
Let me know your preference, and I’ll generate the exact workflow file for your repo!

You said: ok, then what is gitlab and difference
ok, then what is gitlab and difference between gitlab vs github
Copilot said: Great question! **GitHub** and **GitLab** are both
Great question! GitHub and GitLab are both popular platforms for hosting, managing, and collaborating on code using Git. However, they have some important differences. Here’s an easy-to-understand comparison:

What is GitLab?
GitLab is a web-based DevOps platform that provides Git repository management, issue tracking, CI/CD pipelines, code review, and more.
It can be hosted on gitlab.com (cloud) or installed on your own server (self-hosted).
GitHub vs GitLab: Key Differences
Feature	GitHub	GitLab
Ownership	Owned by Microsoft	Independent, open-core company
Hosting Options	Cloud only (github.com), limited self-host (Enterprise)	Cloud (gitlab.com) or full self-hosted
CI/CD	GitHub Actions (powerful, easy, integrated)	Built-in CI/CD (very powerful, deeply integrated)
Issue Tracking	Yes, good for basic project management	Yes, more advanced (supports Epics, milestones)
Merge Requests	Called “Pull Requests”	Called “Merge Requests”
Free Private Repos	Yes	Yes
Wiki & Pages	Yes, supports wikis and GitHub Pages	Yes, supports wikis and GitLab Pages
DevOps Tools	Integrates with third-party tools	All-in-one platform: code, CI/CD, security, deployments
Community	Largest developer community, open source focus	Smaller community, more enterprise focus
Permissions	Granular, but some advanced features are paid	Very granular, more open-source options
Unique Features
GitHub:

Largest open-source community.
GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
Dependabot for security.
Copilot for AI-powered coding.
Better social features (stars, followers).
GitLab:

Full DevOps lifecycle (code, CI, security, deployment, monitoring—all in one).
Self-hosting is easy and free.
More advanced built-in project management tools.
Summary Table
Use Case	GitHub	GitLab
Open Source Collaboration	Best choice, huge community	Good, but smaller community
Enterprise/Private Projects	Good, but advanced features cost	Excellent, more built-in features
Self-hosting (on your server)	Limited, paid options	Free and easy
All-in-one DevOps Platform	Needs integrations	Everything built-in
In Simple Terms:
GitHub is best for open source, social coding, and easy cloud setup.
GitLab is best for all-in-one DevOps, private/self-hosted projects, and advanced automation.

no is gitlab notgithub then how we are pulling gitlab repositories to gitlab?
Copilot said: Great clarification! Let’s break down your questions: --- ##
Great clarification! Let’s break down your questions:

1. What is GitLab?
GitLab is a platform similar to GitHub, but it’s a separate service.
You host your code repositories on gitlab.com or on your own server using GitLab’s software.
2. How do you “pull” GitLab repositories?
The Git system is the same for both GitHub and GitLab!
You can clone, pull, push, and fetch using normal Git commands, regardless of the hosting platform.
Key Point:

The commands do not change, only the remote URL (the address of the repository) changes.
Example: Cloning a GitLab Repo
Suppose you have a repository called my-repo on GitLab at https://gitlab.com/username/my-repo.git.

To clone:

bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/username/my-repo.git
To pull updates:

bash
git pull origin main
To push changes:

bash
git push origin main
How do you create or work with GitLab repositories?
You sign in to gitlab.com
Create a new project/repository.
Use the URL it gives you to clone, pull, and push with Git commands.
Migrating from GitHub to GitLab or vice versa?
You can import GitHub repositories into GitLab using the “Import” feature on GitLab.
You can also export code from GitLab and push it to GitHub.
Summary
Git system is the same for both platforms.
The difference is where the code is hosted:
GitHub: github.com/username/repo.git
GitLab: gitlab.com/username/repo.git
You pull from GitLab by using its repository URL with standard Git commands.
Do you want step-by-step instructions for creating a GitLab repo or pulling code from GitLab? Let me know!

yes
Copilot said: Thanks for confirming! Here’s a **step-by-step guide**
Thanks for confirming! Here’s a step-by-step guide for working with a GitLab repository using Git commands, similar to how you work with GitHub.

How to Pull (Clone) a GitLab Repository
Suppose your GitLab repository is at:
https://gitlab.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:

bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
This will create a local copy of the repository on your computer.

Step 2: Make Changes
Navigate into your cloned repo:

bash
cd your-repo
Edit files, add new files, etc.

Step 3: Add and Commit Your Changes
bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Step 4: Push Changes to GitLab
bash
git push origin main
(Replace main with your branch name if you’re using a different branch.)

Step 5: Pull Latest Changes from GitLab
If someone else made changes, update your local copy:

bash
git pull origin main
Summary Table
Action	Command Example
Clone repo	git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
Add changes	git add .
Commit changes	git commit -m "Message"
Push changes	git push origin main
Pull changes	git pull origin main
Note:
The Git workflow (clone, pull, push, etc.) is identical for both GitHub and GitLab—the only thing that changes is the repository URL.
GitLab also supports issues, merge requests (PRs), and CI/CD pipelines (just like GitHub).
Do you want help with GitLab’s web interface (creating issues, merge requests, or setting up CI/CD pipelines)? Let me know what you want to try next!

Open your terminal and run:

bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/test-repo.git
This downloads the repo to your machine.

Step 4: Work With Your Repo
Navigate to your repo folder:

bash
cd test-repo
Now you can add files, edit code, etc.

Step 5: Push Changes Back to GitLab
For example, add a Python file:

bash
echo 'print("Hello from GitLab!")' > hello_gitlab.py
git add hello_gitlab.py
git commit -m "Add hello_gitlab.py"
git push origin main
Step 6: Pull Changes From GitLab
If someone else made changes, update your local copy:

bash
git pull origin main
Summary Table
Action	Command Example
Clone repo	git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/test-repo.git
Add changes	git add .
Commit changes	git commit -m "Message"
Push changes	git push origin main
Pull changes	git pull origin main


Here’s a step-by-step guide for creating an issue, a merge request (PR), and setting up a CI/CD pipeline in GitLab. This is similar to what you would do on GitHub, but with GitLab’s interface and terminology.

1. Create an Issue in GitLab
Go to your GitLab repository (e.g., https://gitlab.com/yourusername/your-repo).
Click on Issues in the left sidebar.
Click New issue.
Fill in the title and description (e.g., "Add hello_gitlab.py for greeting").
Click Submit issue.
2. Clone Your Repository and Make Changes Locally
Clone your repo:

bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Create a new branch:

bash
git checkout -b add-greeting
Add a new file (example for Python):

bash
echo 'print("Hello from GitLab!")' > hello_gitlab.py
git add hello_gitlab.py
git commit -m "Add hello_gitlab.py"
git push origin add-greeting
3. Create a Merge Request (GitLab PR)
Go to your repo on GitLab.
Click Merge Requests in the sidebar.
Click New merge request.
Select your source branch (add-greeting) and target branch (main).
Fill out the title and description.
Click Submit merge request.
4. Set Up CI/CD in GitLab
GitLab uses a .gitlab-ci.yml file (similar to GitHub Actions).

Example: Simple Python CI Pipeline
Create the following file in your repo:


.gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
  - test

test_python:
  stage: test
  script:
How to add:

Place this .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root of your repository.
Commit and push it to your branch or main.
What Happens Next?
When you push your branch or create a merge request, GitLab will automatically run the pipeline you set up in .gitlab-ci.yml.
You can see the pipeline results in the “CI/CD” section of your repository.
